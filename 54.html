What's with the Quality?</strong><pre>It's important to understand that "Quality" thing you see on the info page. They're most commonly known as "prints".<br><br>1. HDCAM - Low quality - It's available right from the day of release. HDCAM is for the people who just can't wait.<br><br>2. HDTC - Low/Medium quality - It's a bit better than HDCAM and "watchable" as we like to call it.<br><br>3. HDRIP - High quality - This is where the game starts. Most people wait for this print because it has high quality audio and video.<br><br>4. HDTV - High/Great quality - HDTV is rare and quite similar to HDRIP.<br><br>5. WEB-HD/WEB-DL - Excellent quality - This is available when the movie/series is available on streaming platforms such Prime, Netflix, etc. <br><br>6. BluRay - Outstanding quality - This may take anywhere between 6 to 12 months and this is best you can get.<br><br>All in all, HDCAM/HDTC - For people who can't wait.<br>            HDTV/HDRIP/WEB-DL/BluRay - For quality lovers.</pre><p><strong>2. Why only 720p?</strong></p><pre>Not everyone has unlimited data. 720p movies usually amount for 1GB<br>whereas 1080p movies easily go above 2GB. The difference between 720p and 1080p is not significant especially in phones.</pre><p><strong>3. What makes Night Owl different?</strong></p><pre>There are many other services available on the Internet very similar to Night Owl but what makes us different is the quality of service. We use Google Drive which is the fastest storage solution on the Internet. Easy-to-use app. Regular movies/series updates and many more.</pre><p><strong>4. What is Google Drive(Gdrive)? What makes it special?</strong></p><pre>Gdrive is the fastest storage solution on the Internet. It's faster, safer and much more consistent than Torrents or any other service for that matter.</pre><p><strong>5. How to request for movies/series?</strong></p><pre>Use the request portal button present on the left side of the FAQ button.</pre><p><strong>6. What about Subtitles?</strong></p><pre>Most of the Movies/Series on Night Owl already come with Subtitles and you can always add subtitles manually using any 3rd party service. We recommend "<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=sunnyappz.GetSubtitles">Get Subtitles</a>" app, available for free on Play Store.</pre><p><strong>7. Link is opening in Drive app?</strong></p><pre>Clicking on the 'Download' button will always open in Drive app if you have it installed. If you're comfortable with the Drive app then go ahead by all means otherwise you can disable/uninstall the Drive app which will make your downloads easier.</pre></div></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright">©Night Owl</div></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="http://nightowlapp.ml/assets/js/jquery-3.2.1.slim.min.js?v=f307ecc7f6353949f03c06ffa70652a2"></script><script defer="defer" src="http://nightowlapp.ml/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=3b94d4998f24c4cebb952de3a9b15b22"></script></body></html>
