HDCAM - Low quality - It's usually available right from the day of release. HDCAM is for the people who just can't wait.<br><br>2. HDTC - Low/Medium quality - It's a bit better than HDCAM and "watchable" as we like to call it.<br><br>3. HDRIP - High quality - This is where the game starts. Most people wait for this print because it has high quality audio and video.<br><br>4. HDTV - High/Great quality - HDTV is quite similar to HDRIP.<br><br>5. WEB-DL - Excellent quality - This is available when the movie/series is available on streaming platforms such PrimeVideo, Netflix, etc. <br><br>6. BluRay - Outstanding quality - This may take anywhere between 6 to 12 months and this is best you can get.<br><br>All in all,<br>HDCAM/HDTC - For people who can't wait.<br>HDRIP/WEB-DL/BluRay - For quality lovers.</pre></details><p> </p><details><summary><strong>2. Link is always opening in Drive app?</strong></summary><figure class="post__video"><iframe class="lazyload" width="560" height="314" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gQwSU6x4tfU" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure><pre>We don't recommend the use of Drive app because it comes with its own flaws. Now, there are 2 ways to stop Drive app from snatching the link:<br><br>1. Fixing the Default behaviour: (Recommended)<br>Watch the video above or follow these steps -<br>i. Open Settings &gt; Apps.<br>ii. Search for "Drive" app.<br>iii. Click on "Open by default" (or similar).<br>iv. Click on "Open supported links in the app".<br>v. Choose "Ask every time". That's it!<br><br>2. Disabling/Uninstalling the Drive app:<br>In case if the above method doesn't work, you can disable the "Drive" app entirely -<br>i. Open Settings &gt; Apps.<br>ii. Search for "Drive" app.<br>iii. Click on "Disable" or "Uninstall".<br><br>NOTE: These steps might not be exactly the same depending on the Android version and UI!</pre></details><p> </p><details><summary><strong>3. How to Download movies?</strong></summary><figure class="post__video"><iframe class="lazyload" width="560" height="314" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2MQqGogUjkA" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure><pre><br>After the release of Night Owl v7, we had to change the Download method due to a limitation of Google Drive where users could not download anything for upto 24hrs after a certain amount of downloads. We decided to use a 3rd party service called "Drivebox" and here's how it works:<br>1. Click on the "Download" button.<br>2. Choose a browser.<br>3. Click on "Login to Download". (*)<br>4. Allow Klop to link with your Google account. (*)<br>5. Click on "Download" on the next page.<br>10. Click "Download Anyway". That's it!<br>(*) -- These steps are required only for the first time.<br><br>NOTES:<br>1. Don't use your primary Gmail ID!<br>2. Drivebox comes with its own ads. It's recommended to use a browser with an ad-blocker.<br>3. Drivebox copies the file to your Drive account so you should always delete those movies (incl. from trash) and make sure you have enough space in your Google Drive.<br>4. Drivebox is a 3rd party service and Night Owl does not guarantee about the proper functionality/safety/usability/etc.<br>5. The steps may not be exactly as shown in the video depending on your Android UI.<br>6. This method is applicable to movies added after Night Owl v7. Report Movies with download link other than "drivebox.club" or Direct Gdrive(drive.google.com).</pre></details><p> </p><details><summary><strong>4. How to Download Series?</strong></summary><figure class="post__video"><iframe class="lazyload" width="560" height="314" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-cqmYNmYGKw" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure><pre>You can Download one episode at a time or entire season at once. Watch the video to learn how.<br><br>Notes:<br>1. Your browser must support "Desktop Mode" to download the entire season at once.(Chrome, Kiwi, etc.)<br>2. You need to have a zip extractor app (ZArchiver recommended).<br>3. Some seasons may have 2 or more zip files, in which case you should always keep those parts in 1 folder and extract the 1st zip file, the other zip files should extract automatically.</pre></details><p> </p><details><summary><strong>5. How to Watch Online/Stream?</strong></summary><figure class="post__video"><iframe class="lazyload" width="560" height="314" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iamK-8AVbTo" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure><pre><br>Night Owl now uses an external video player to stream Movies and for that a supported video player is required (<strong>works best with VLC Media Player</strong>).<br>Features offered by movie streaming via VLC Player:<br>1. Switch between audios (if available).<br>2. Disable/switch subtitles (if available).<br>3. Add external subtitles.<br>and more...<br><br>For Movies:<br>1. Follow the Download process.<br>2.

Click on the "Download" button.<br>2. Select season.<br>3. Choose your desired episode.<br>4. Click on the Download button.<br>5. Stop at the final page and just copy the link.<br>6. Click on "Watch Now" and paste the link.<br>7. Again click on "Watch Now" and Enjoy!<br><br>NOTE:<br>1. Streaming issues with video players other than VLC won't be entertained.</pre></details><p> </p><details><summary><strong>6. Why only 720p?</strong></summary><pre>Not everyone has unlimited data. 720p movies usually take around 1GB of storage space whereas 1080p movies easily go above 2GB and the difference between 720p and 1080p is not significant especially in phones. About 480p, the quality is noticeably bad but it's still enjoyable and uses much less data; we might include 480p in the future.</pre></details><p> </p><details><summary><strong>7. How to Report bugs/issues?</strong></summary><pre>You should always Report Movie/Series related issues using the Report button (⚠) present on top of every Movies and Series page. In case of app issues (crashes, unknown errors, etc.), you can report these issues in <a href="https://t.me/nightowlfam">our Telegram Group</a> (preferred) or email us at "intel.nightowl@gmail.com".</pre></details><p> </p><details><summary><strong>8.

What makes Night Owl different?</strong></summary><pre>There are many other services available on the Internet very similar to Night Owl but what makes us different is:<br>1. 100% Ad-Free!<br>2. The quality of service.<br>3. We use Google Drive which is the fastest storage solution on the Internet.<br>4. Easy-to-use app.<br>5. Regular movies/series updates.</pre></details><p> </p><details><summary><strong>10. What is Google Drive(Gdrive)? What makes it special?</strong></summary><pre>Gdrive is the fastest storage solution on the Internet. It's faster, safer and much more consistent than Torrents or any other service for that matter.</pre></details><p> </p><details><summary><strong>11. How to request for movies/series?</strong></summary><pre>Use the Request button(+) present on the left side of the FAQ button(!).</pre></details><p> </p><details><summary><strong>12.
