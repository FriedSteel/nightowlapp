What's with the Quality?</strong></summary><pre>It's important to understand that "Quality" thing you see on the info page(also known as "prints").<br><br>1. HDCAM - Low quality - It's usually available right from the day of release. HDCAM is for the people who just can't wait.<br><br>2. HDTC - Low/Medium quality - It's a bit better than HDCAM and "watchable" as we like to call it.<br><br>3. HDRIP - High quality - This is where the game starts. Most people wait for this print because it has high quality audio and video.<br><br>4. WEB-DL - Excellent quality - This is available when the movie/series is available on streaming platforms such PrimeVideo, Netflix, etc. <br><br>5. BluRay - Outstanding quality - This is best you can get.<br><br>All in all,<br>HDCAM/HDTC - For people who can't wait.<br>HDRIP/WEB-DL/BluRay - For quality lovers.</pre></details><p> </p><details><summary><strong>3.
