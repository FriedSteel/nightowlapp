What's with the Quality?</strong></summary><pre>It's important to understand that "Quality" thing you see on the info page(also known as "prints").<br><br>1. HDCAM - Low quality - It's usually available right from the day of release. HDCAM is for the people who just can't wait.<br><br>2. HDTC - Low/Medium quality - It's a bit better than HDCAM and "watchable" as we like to call it.<br><br>3. HDRIP - High quality - This is where the game starts. Most people wait for this print because it has high quality audio and video.<br><br>4. HDTV - High/Great quality - HDTV is quite similar to HDRIP.<br><br>5. WEB-DL - Excellent quality - This is available when the movie/series is available on streaming platforms such PrimeVideo, Netflix, etc. <br><br>6. BluRay - Outstanding quality - This may take anywhere between 6 to 12 months and this is best you can get.<br><br>All in all,<br>HDCAM/HDTC - For people who can't wait.<br>HDRIP/WEB-DL/BluRay - For quality lovers.</pre></details><p> </p><details><summary><strong>2. Link is always opening in Drive app?</strong></summary><figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gQwSU6x4tfU" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure><pre>We don't recommend the use of Drive app because it comes with its own flaws. Now, there are 2 ways to stop Drive app from snatching the link:<br><br>1. Fixing the Default behaviour: (Recommended)<br>Watch the video above or follow these steps -<br>i. Open Settings &gt; Apps.<br>ii. Search for "Drive" app.<br>iii. Click on "Open by default" (or similar).<br>iv. Click on "Open supported links in the app".<br>v. Choose "Ask every time". That's it!<br><br>2. Disabling/Uninstalling the Drive app:<br>In case if the above method doesn't work, you can disable the "Drive" app entirely -<br>i. Open Settings &gt; Apps.<br>ii. Search for "Drive" app.<br>iii. Click on "Disable" or "Uninstall".<br><br>NOTE: These steps might not be exactly the same depending on the Android version and UI!</pre></details><p> </p><details><summary><strong>3. How to Download movies?</strong></summary><figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2MQqGogUjkA" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure><pre><br>After the release of Night Owl v7, we had to change the Download method due to a limitation of Google Drive where users could not download anything for upto 24hrs after a certain amount of downloads. We decided to use a 3rd party service called "Drivebox" and here's how it works:<br>1. Click on the "Download" button.<br>2. Choose a browser.<br>3. Click on "Login to Download". (*)<br>4. Allow Klop to link with your Google account. (*)<br>5. Click on "Download" on the next page.<br>10. Click "Download Anyway". That's it!<br>(*) -- These steps are required only for the first time.<br><br>NOTES:<br>1. Don't use your primary Gmail ID!<br>2. Drivebox comes with its own ads. It's recommended to use a browser with an ad-blocker.<br>3. Drivebox copies the file to your Drive account so you should always delete those movies (incl. from trash) and make sure you have enough space in your Google Drive.<br>4. Drivebox is a 3rd party service and Night Owl does not guarantee about the proper functionality/safety/usability/etc.<br>5. The steps may not be exactly as shown in the video depending on your Android UI.<br>6. This method is applicable to movies added after Night Owl v7. Report Movies with download link other than "drivebox.club" or Direct Gdrive(drive.google.com).</pre></details><p> </p><details><summary><strong>4. How to Download Series?</strong></summary><figure class="post__video"><iframe loading="lazy" width="560" height="314" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-cqmYNmYGKw" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-mce-fragment="1"></iframe></figure><pre>You can Download one episode at a time or entire season at once. Watch the video to learn how.<br><br>Notes:<br>1. Your browser must support "Desktop Mode" to download the entire season at once.(Chrome, Kiwi, etc.)<br>2. You need to have a zip extractor app (ZArchiver recommended).<br>3. Some seasons may have 2 or more zip files, in which case you should always keep those parts in 1 folder and extract the 1st zip file, the other zip files should extract automatically.</pre></details><p> </p><details><summary><strong>5.

What makes Night Owl different?</strong></summary><pre>There are many other services available on the Internet very similar to Night Owl but what makes us different is:<br>1. The quality of service.<br>2. We use Google Drive which is the fastest storage solution on the Internet.<br>3. Easy-to-use app.<br>4. Regular movies/series updates.<br>and many more reasons to give Night Owl a shot!</pre></details><p> </p><details><summary><strong>9. What is Google Drive(Gdrive)?
